The Prophecy Project
===============

Thesis
----------
Inspired by Ibe Van Geel's work at mmodata.net and Sir Bruce (mmogchart.com); The Prophecy Project is an ongoing effort to track the social media metrics for many of today's most 'massive' online games.


Resources
-------
The directories here serve several purposes. Files located in 'DIGNIN' are my current scraping scripts, utilizing Facebook's and Twitter's API, with screen scraping Reddit. Files located in 'ARCHIVE', are unsurprisingly, older scripts back when everything was screen scraped. 'DIGNINDOJ' will include files that are in the process of being tested, yet haven't been implemented.
